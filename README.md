> Working on features such as, the ability to attach images, and an AI auto snippet recognition

Features
---

> Create different categories for each snippet. Snippets are made up of text, and allow the user to save pieces of text, or code that they may want to reuse or remember in the future

1. Create custom snippets
2. Categorize snippets
3. Select or copy text and click `New` to automatically add it to the snippet.
4. Import files with text in order to highlight different sections in order to create new snippets
5. Filter through your snippets however you'd like for quick and easy access
6. Text highlighting for code snippets
